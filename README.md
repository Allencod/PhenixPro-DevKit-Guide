# The PhenixPro Flight Controller DevKit

The PhenixPro DevKit is an intelligent mobile robot control, computing and networking platform. It's integrated in a Xilinx Zynq SoC, with dual core ARM Cortex-A9 CPU and FPGA fabric on a signal chip. It is also running PhenOS\(based on freeRTOS\) and Linux on each CPU core respectively. Attitude estimation, flight control, navigation are implemented by ArduPilot\(http://ardupilot.org\). So far, it only support quadcopter\(we call it flying robot\).
